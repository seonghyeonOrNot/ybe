# Annual Leave Policy (연차 휴가 정책)

**Effective Date**: 2026-01-31
**Version**: 1.0
**Related Spec**: TSK1-YBE3

## Purpose

This policy establishes the guidelines for annual leave (연차) management in accordance with the Korean Labor Standards Act (근로기준법) and ensures fair and consistent application of leave benefits across all employees.

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees of the organization, including:
- Full-time employees (정규직)
- Part-time employees (시간제)
- Contract employees (계약직)

## Legal Foundation

This policy is based on:
- **Korean Labor Standards Act (근로기준법)** Article 60 (Annual Paid Leave)
- **Enforcement Decree of the Labor Standards Act**
- Company employment regulations

## 1. Annual Leave Entitlement

### 1.1 Standard Entitlement

All employees are entitled to annual paid leave as follows:

#### First Year of Employment
- **New employees**: 1 day per month for the first year (maximum 11 days)
  - Condition: Must work 80% or more of each month
  - Accrual date: 1st day of the following month
  - Example: Employee hired on March 15 receives 1 day on April 1

- **After completing 1 year**: 15 days of annual leave
  - Granted on the anniversary date of employment
  - Replaces monthly accrued leave going forward

#### Second Year and Beyond
- **Base**: 15 days per year
- **Additional**: +1 day for each year of continuous service
- **Maximum**: 25 days (after 10 years of service)

#### Calculation Formula
```
Annual Leave = 15 days + min((Years of Service - 1), 10)
Maximum = 25 days
```

### 1.2 Part-time Employees

Part-time employees receive proportional leave based on working hours:

```
Annual Leave = Standard Leave × (Actual Working Hours / Standard Working Hours)
```

**Example**:
- Standard working hours: 40 hours/week
- Part-time working hours: 20 hours/week
- Entitled leave: 15 days × (20/40) = 7.5 days (rounded to 8 days)

### 1.3 Contract Employees

Contract employees follow the same rules as regular employees for the duration of their contract. Upon contract renewal, service years continue to accumulate.

## 2. Leave Accrual and Allocation

### 2.1 Timing

- **Monthly accrual** (first-year employees): Granted on the 1st of each month
- **Annual allocation**: Granted on January 1 for returning employees, or on employment anniversary date
- **New hires**: Begin monthly accrual immediately upon hire

### 2.2 Attendance Requirement

To qualify for monthly accrual or annual allocation:
- Employees must maintain **80% attendance** rate
- Excused absences (approved leave, official business trips) count as attendance
- Unexcused absences reduce the attendance rate

### 2.3 Prorated Allocation

#### Mid-year Hires
Employees hired during the year receive prorated leave:
```
Prorated Leave = (Remaining months in year / 12) × Annual entitlement
```

#### Termination
Upon termination, unused leave is paid out or used as final working days, per company policy and employee preference.
